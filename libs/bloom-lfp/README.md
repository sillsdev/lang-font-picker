# bloom-lfp

This Language Picker was extracted from Bloom Desktop v6 as found in
https://github.com/BloomBooks/BloomDesktop/tree/Version6.0/src/BloomBrowserUI
with the goal of expanding/modifying the design of `headless-lfp` (and possibly `unstyled-lfp`)
so that it can be used with Bloom.

## Running Storybook stories

Run `nx storybook bloom-lfp` to launch Storybook with this project.
